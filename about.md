![Me]({{ "/assets/dm.jpg" | absolute_url }})

I am a PhD student in machine learning at the [University of Salford](https://www.salford.ac.uk/research/health-sciences/research-groups/diagnostic-imaging) in Manchester. My research is looking at using machine learning to identify women at risk from cardiovascular disease from breast-screening mammograms.
