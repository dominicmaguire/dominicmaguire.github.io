I am mainly using the following tools:
* [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/): Comprehensive reference management software that allows highlighting, notes, sharing, exporting to BibTex etc. It's free too.
* [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/): I am using this IDE with the [TeXlipse](http://projects.eclipse.org/projects/science.texlipse) plugin to generate my main thesis document using LaTex.
* [MATLAB](https://matlab.mathworks.com/): Main programming environment for developing and testing deep learning models.
* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/): Document backup.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/dominicmaguire): Code backup.
* [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/): Good for getting into the zone.
